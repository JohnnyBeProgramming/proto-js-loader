# Dynamic Script and Style Loader (Javascript)

This package imports and attaches (inline), the given external JavaScript and CSS resources.

Individual scripts that are imported can be tracked and some basic detection and error handling is also available.

Another usefull built in feature is the deferred queue chain. Any operation can be queued rather than be executed immediately. The queued script chain can then be executed with a commit statement, with retry and fail handlers built in.

## Getting Started

You can install the library from npm:

    npm install proto-js-loader --save-dev

## Example Usage

In NodeJS you can access the library with the require keyword:

    // Example usage:
    var remoteScripts = require('proto-js-loader');
    
    // Simply define what you want loaded
    remoteScripts.define('https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.2/css/bootstrap.min.css');
    remoteScripts.define('https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.2/js/bootstrap.js');
    
    // Inject styles and scripts directly into the document header
    remoteScripts.define([
      'https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.2/css/bootstrap.min.css',
      'https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.2/js/bootstrap.js'
    ], null, function (url, info){ 
      console.log('Done:', url); 
    }, document.body);
    

## Motivation

This library was written because I needed a way to inject styles and javscript dynamically, with greater control over when a script load failed (or succeeded), and have a handy retry feature. 

## Tests

No tests have been set up for this project.
