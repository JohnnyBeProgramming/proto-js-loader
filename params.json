{"name":"Dynamic Script Loader (Javascript)","tagline":"Prototyped script loader for javascript clients","body":"# Dynamic Script Loader (Javascript)\r\n\r\nThis package imports and attaches (inline), the given external JavaScript and CSS resources.\r\n\r\nIndividual scripts that are imported can be tracked and some basic detection and error handling is also available.\r\n\r\nAnother usefull built in feature is the deferred queue chain. Any operation can be queued rather than be executed immediately. The queued script chain can then be executed with a commit statement, with retry and fail handlers built in.\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\nYou can install the library from npm:\r\n\r\n    npm install proto-js-loader --save-dev\r\n\r\n## Example Usage\r\n\r\nOn the client, you can then do:\r\n\r\n    // Simply define what you want loaded\r\n    remoteScripts.define('https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.2/css/bootstrap.min.css');\r\n    remoteScripts.define('https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.2/js/bootstrap.js');\r\n    \r\n    // Inject into the document header with callbacks\r\n    remoteScripts.define([\r\n      'https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.2/css/bootstrap.min.css',\r\n      'https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.2/js/bootstrap.js'\r\n    ], null, function (url, info){ \r\n      console.log('Done:', url); \r\n    }, document.head);\r\n    \r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nThis library was written because I needed a way to inject styles and javscript dynamically, with greater control over when a script load failed (or succeeded), and have a handy retry feature. \r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n\r\nNo tests have been set up for this project.\r\n\r\n## Contributors\r\n\r\nThis library is provided \"as-is\" and totally free to use. No support comes with it. If you want to make a contribution or include a new feature, you can create a pull request. I will reserve the right to update this package as new requirements become available.   \r\n\r\n## MIT License\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2014-2015 JohnnyBeProgramming - http://www.prototyped.info\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\r\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
